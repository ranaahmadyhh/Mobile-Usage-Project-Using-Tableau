# 📱 Mobile Usage Analysis Using Tableau

Welcome to the **Mobile Usage Analysis** project! This project leverages a mobile usage dataset to generate insightful visualizations using Tableau. The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and formatted in **Excel**, then imported into **Tableau** to create compelling visual insights. 🎨📊

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing mobile usage patterns across different demographics, including **gender**, **location**, **age**, and **app categories**. The dataset provides key insights into how different factors impact mobile usage and how individuals engage with their mobile devices.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before diving into Tableau, I cleaned and prepared the dataset using **Microsoft Excel**. The following tasks were performed:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed any inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Data Filtering**: Filtered data to ensure accuracy.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensured all columns were in a consistent format for easy analysis.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. **Average Screen Time by Gender and Location** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🌍
This visualization compares the average screen time of users based on their **gender** and **location**.

- **Insight**: Geographical location and gender have a minimal impact on average screen time. People’s screen time habits are generally consistent, regardless of their gender or where they live.

### 2. **Average Hours Spent on App Categories** 🎮📱
This visual compares the average hours users spend on various **app categories** like **Gaming**, **Productivity**, and **Social Media**.

- **Insight**: Users spend a remarkably similar amount of time across different app categories. This indicates that mobile usage patterns are more consistent across categories than one might expect.

### 3. **Average Number of Apps Used by Age Category** 👵👶
This visualization shows the **average number of apps** used by different **age categories**.

- **Insight**: The data reveals that users in the **55+** age group have the highest number of applications installed. However, this difference is minimal, suggesting that age does not significantly influence the number of apps used.

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations

- **Minimal Impact of Gender and Location**: Screen time is consistent across genders and locations, indicating that external factors like where someone lives or their gender identity do not significantly impact mobile usage.
  
- **Balanced App Usage**: The equal distribution of time across app categories (e.g., gaming, productivity, social media) suggests that individuals tend to engage with various types of apps similarly. Brands and developers may want to focus on ensuring their apps are engaging across different categories.

- **Age and App Variety**: Older age groups (55+) tend to have a slightly higher number of apps installed, although this difference is not significant. Marketers and app developers may want to consider offering easy-to-use apps for older users without assuming a major shift in app variety.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Excel**: For data cleaning, formatting, and filtering.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and insights.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of visualizing mobile usage data through Tableau to uncover patterns and insights that can influence app development, marketing strategies, and even personal mobile habits. By understanding how different factors affect usage, we can tailor user experiences more effectively.
